          <h4>#JavaScript</h4>
        </article>
        <article class="article-body">
          <p>When we design functions that operate on objects or data flows (in this example an object) they are
            usually functions that do a single task, with a single level of abstraction and without side effects which
            causes that to perform complex tasks we need to perform the combination of several of them. Therefore, it
            develops chained methods since they allow a more readable code, and it is the side effect of having been
            performing the previous "duties" well when designing the functions.
            <br><br>
            If you know Linux, you have to think that all the commands are intended to do just one thing and do it well
            but we have a complex operating system working with simple functions. This is achieved thanks to the use of
            pipes to combine the different commands.
            <br><br>
            In our specific case, we have to build something similar, whether using objects or functions. In the
            following examples, we illustrate the Car class in which chained methods are used versus traditional ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this post, we have addressed how to apply clean code to a fundamental piece for developers, which
            we find in all programming languages: Functions.
            <br><br>
            The design of functions applying clean code is essential because the functions are the basic element to
            decouple the code. However, bad practices in the design of functions can lead us to keep the code as coupled
            as without them but with the complexity of introducing functions. In addition, the poor design of the
            functions leads to serious bugs that are difficult to find. As we rise in the levels of software
            abstraction, it will be more difficult to locate the points where the bugs occur.
            <br><br>
            Therefore, the recommendations presented in this post will make you scale a level in the quality of your
            code, but do not apply them without sufficient reflection. Remember, there are no magic tips or silver
            bullets but there is a set of techniques that will allow you to solve a wider range of problems.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the points we have addressed are the following:
            <br><br>
            Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals.
            Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally).
            Avoid side effects - Global Variables.
            Avoid side effects - Objects Mutables.
            Functions should do one thing.
            Functions should only be one level of abstraction.
            Favor functional programming over imperative programming.

          <p>Thank you very much!

            I have already thought up to 6 parts for it!
